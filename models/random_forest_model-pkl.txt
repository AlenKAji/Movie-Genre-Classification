The Random Forest model file (random_forest_model.pkl) is too large to be uploaded directly to this GitHub repository.

Please download it manually from the following link:
https://drive.google.com/file/d/17fKAJChiDLaLHX4CA4X75jRtL1bvEu9Q/view?usp=sharing

After downloading, place the file into the 'models/' directory as follows:

models/
└── random_forest_model.pkl

This will allow the project to correctly load the Random Forest model during evaluation and prediction.
