# üé¨ Movie Genre Classification

## ‚ú® Task Objectives

The objective of this project is to build a **multi-model movie genre classification system** based on **plot summaries**.  
The system leverages both traditional machine learning techniques and modern deep learning approaches to classify plots into genres.

Models implemented:
- **Random Forest** with TF-IDF vectorization and handcrafted features
- **BERT + Logistic Regression** (shallow neural model with BERT embeddings)
- **BERT + MLP** (deep neural network on BERT embeddings using Keras)

The project emphasizes:
- Comparative analysis between classical ML and BERT-based models
- Handling class imbalance with appropriate strategies
- Saving and visualizing model performances
- User interaction to predict genre from custom plot input

## üõ† Steps to Run the Project

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AlenKAji/movie-genre-classification.git
   cd movie-genre-classification
   ```
2. **Download and Prepare the Dataset**

This project utilizes the [Genre Classification Dataset IMDb](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hijest/genre-classification-dataset-imdb) from Kaggle.

   a. Visit the dataset page and download the dataset files.</br>
   
   b. Create a folder named `Genre Classification Dataset/` in the root directory of your project.</br>
   
   c. Place the following files into this folder:</br>
      - `train_data.txt`</br>
      - `test_data.txt`</br>
      - `test_data_solution.txt`</br>
      </br>

3. **Download Trained Models**

The trained model files are too large to be stored directly in this GitHub repository.  
They are hosted externally and can be downloaded from the following links:

- [Download BERT + Logistic Regression Model (`bert_logreg_model.pkl`)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HNbVMx4Urp3xBFocM1DSb87gXgjJyou-/view?usp=sharing)
- [Download BERT + MLP Model (`bert_mlp_model.h5`)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KntDz2Ds5uWdyqeidfgXvbPV-9Q0lYAk/view?usp=sharing)
- [Download Label Encoder for BERT + MLP (`bert_mlp_encoder.pkl`)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1yxQER1G02VEZWQnrA5trVd7meL9aeUMf/view?usp=sharing)
- [Download Random Forest Model (`random_forest_model.pkl`)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17fKAJChiDLaLHX4CA4X75jRtL1bvEu9Q/view?usp=sharing)

After downloading, please place the models into the `models/` directory of the project:




2. **Install the required dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the project**
   ```bash
   python model.py
   ```

4. **View outputs**

   All results (saved models, confusion matrices, misclassified examples, classification reports) will be automatically saved in the `models/` directory.

5. **Make custom predictions**

   After evaluation, the system will prompt you to input your own movie plot, and each model will predict the genre.

## üõ† Requirements

- Python 3.10
- See `requirements.txt` for full list

---

## üßπ Code Quality

- **Clean architecture**: Code is modularized across multiple files (`bert_lr_model.py`, `random_forest.py`, etc.)
- **Well-commented**: Each function is documented with docstrings and inline comments
- **Reproducible**: Fixed model saving paths ensure reproducibility
- **Scalable**: Easy to plug new models or vectorizers into the pipeline
